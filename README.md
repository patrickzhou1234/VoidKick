# VoidKick

This project is based on [Moist3dEditor](https://github.com/patrickzhou1234/Moist3dEditor).

The original project was created completely without vibecoding (AI assistance) in 2022, back when AI couldn't even do this stuff!

I vibecoded this version to transform it into a multiplayer game and added more features to create **VoidKick**.

## Directions

To run the project:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
